/*
This class implements a two-stack algorithm for evaluating arithmetic expressions.

Key components:
1. Two stacks: 
   - ops: for storing operators
   - vals: for storing numeric values

2. The evaluate method:
   - Takes a string input representing an arithmetic expression
   - Returns the result as a double

Algorithm steps:
1. Split the input string into tokens (numbers, operators, parentheses)
2. Iterate through each token:
   - If it's an opening parenthesis '(', ignore it
   - If it's an operator (+, -, *, /), push onto ops stack
   - If it's a closing parenthesis ')', perform the calculation:
     a. Pop the top operator from ops
     b. Pop the required number of values from vals
     c. Perform the operation
     d. Push the result back onto vals
   - If it's a number, parse it to double and push onto vals stack

3. After processing all tokens, the final result will be the only item left on vals stack

Important considerations:
- Use .equals() for string comparisons, not ==
- Be careful with the order of operands when popping for binary operations
- Consider adding checks for empty stacks to prevent errors

This implementation provides O(n) time complexity and effectively handles 
operator precedence through the use of parentheses in the input expression.
